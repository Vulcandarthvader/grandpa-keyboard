# 👴 Grandpa Keyboard — A Custom Virtual Keyboard for the Elderly

> A personalized typing interface designed with love and empathy, tailored for my 84-year-old grandfather to use comfortably on his Samsung Galaxy J7.

## 🧓 The Problem

Elderly individuals often face challenges with smartphone usage — especially when typing:

- **Swollen fingers due to age** make it difficult to press small keys
- **Traditional QWERTY layout** is confusing to them — they are more familiar with A-B-C-D order
- **Default smartphone keyboards** are cluttered and not designed with senior citizens in mind
- Lack of tactile feedback and visual comfort makes it frustrating and error-prone

My grandfather, in particular, struggled every day just to type a simple message.

## 💖 Why This Matters

This wasn’t just a coding project — it was a gift.

👴 My grandfather’s face lit up when he heard the typewriter sounds and saw the keyboard in his favorite soft blue color.  
Typing big paragraphs is now easier for him.

This is the power of tech made with empathy. ❤️
